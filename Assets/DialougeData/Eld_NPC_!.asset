  - 'Elder: Hello there! Welcome to Senna, our home.

'
  - "Gordion: Greetings. I..don\u2019t know this place. I seem to have forgotten
    my memories."
  - "Elder: Oh dear! Is there any way we could help you?  Not that there's much we
    can do to a man who\u2019s built like Zeus\u2019 personal bodyguard.\r\n"

'
  - 'Elder: Ok kid, I hope you find success in the journey you embark on.'
